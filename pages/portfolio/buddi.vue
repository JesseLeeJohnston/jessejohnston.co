Project Summary

As a designer, I’ve always felt that people would look down on me if I had cannabis product in my portfolio. It’s been an industry I’ve always seen potential in but until recently it's always suffered from poor design. In April of 2017, I signed up to the local Vancouver Protohack event. I met Ryan at the event and learned about his project Buddi we decided to work together and actually wound up winning the event.

As of right now our product is being tested by a select few dispensaries in Vancouver and many different cannabis producers in British Columbia and Alberta.
