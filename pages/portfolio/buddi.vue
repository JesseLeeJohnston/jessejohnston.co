        <p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
        <p>As a designer, I’ve always felt that people would look down on me if I had cannabis product in my portfolio. It’s been an industry I’ve always seen potential in but until recently it's always suffered from poor design. In April of 2017, I signed up to the local Vancouver Protohack event. I met Ryan at the event and learned about his project Buddi we decided to work together and actually wound up winning the event.</p>
        <p>As of right now our product is being tested by a select few dispensaries in Vancouver and many different cannabis producers in British Columbia and Alberta.</p>

    <p>Currently our MVP is a web based application, we’re looking at different options for making it a native application or a progressive web application. Since our dispensary partners are all primarily using iPads we have optimized it to look best in that context.</p>

    <p>Dispensary customers put in a few details to start and eventually build out a profile. Based on their profile we connect them with products that we predict will be a good match for them.</p>

    <p>Each products content is updated by the producer. As soon as they make a change that information is immediately updated on the dispensaries side. Producers are also able to get direct feedback from customers to help them make better decisions regarding their products.</p>

    <p>Creating sketches and prototypes was critical to the success of the product. Since our team was for the most part working remotely I used InvisionApp to prototype designs prior to actually building anything. This also gave Ryan a chance to meet with dispensaries and get their feedback on the high fidelity mock ups.</p>
    <p>As of right now we're testing the product with a few different dispensaries and getting their feedback.</p>
